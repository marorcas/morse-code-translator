## Description

A simple morse code translator web application for converting English text to Morse code and vice versa. Built using HTML, Sassy CSS and JavaScript. 

## Features

- Includes a "clear" button to clear the content in the input and translation fields.

Instructions and examples on how to use the project.

## Roadmap

Planned future features and improvements: 
- Sometimes there's a problem with the input field being automatically pre-populated with an empty string or space when the app is first launched... Not sure why that is but will have to look into it and fix that.
